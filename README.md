# MONTANA

a COMPLETELY USELESS discord bot

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarkeshi/Montana.git
```

You will need to setup a bot on your server before continuing, follow the directions [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token). Following this, you should have your bot appearing in your server and you should have the Discord bot token.

To start MONTANA export the token as an environment variable and run TLE using:
insert token and guild name in .env and then run bot.py
```bash
python3 bot.py
```
